# app-sec-assign-1
The goal of this assignment is to gain hands on experience with secure coding and application development techniques. This assignment is broken into two parts. In part one you are tasked with developing a spell checker system in C. During part two you will write tests for and fuzz your developed program, likely discovering bugs. These bugs should then be fixed. Reports will be due for each part of this project. This project will apply the secure coding techniques you have learned in class, including the use of version control systems (VCS) and source code management, code testing, fuzzing, and other aspects of secure development.
