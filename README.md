# Assignment 1

*Intro:*
The goal of this assignment is to gain hands on experience with secure coding and application development techniques. This assignment is broken into two parts. In part one you are tasked with developing a spell checker system in C. During part two you will write tests for and fuzz your developed program, likely discovering bugs. These bugs should then be fixed. Reports will be due for each part of this project. This project will apply the secure coding techniques you have learned in class, including the use of version control systems (VCS) and source code management, code testing, fuzzing, and other aspects of secure development.

*Deliverables & Grading:*
This assignment requires you to submit both code and a write-up. The code must be submitted
to gradescope. We require that the code you write be submitted in a file called spell.c. You
should not submit a main function, though you should write a main function for yourself to test
your functionality.
Reports, test cases, and fuzzing output should be submitted in a zip file through NYU classes.
The reports should be submitted with the file name lname_fname_report1.pdf or
lname_fname_report1.txt.
As the filenames above suggest, all report submissions should be in either PDF format or text
format.
